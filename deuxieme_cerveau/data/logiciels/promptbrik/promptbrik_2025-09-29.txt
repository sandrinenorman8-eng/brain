        master_prompt = f"""You are an expert in transforming human instructions into expert-level instructions. Your mission is to process the raw French instruction by strictly following the three phases below.

RAW FRENCH INSTRUCTION TO PROCESS:
"{original_prompt}"

CRITICAL FORMATTING RULE - ENGLISH VERSION:
Never start your response with a line that summarizes, introduces, or labels what follows. No titles, even implicit ones. No introductory sentences. Dive straight into the first useful piece of information. The first line must be the actual beginning of the response, not a description of it.
Before answering, work through this step-by-step:
UNDERSTAND: What is the core question being asked?
ANALYZE: What are the key factors/components involved?
REASON: What logical connections can I make?
SYNTHESIZE: How do these elements combine?
CONCLUDE: What is the most accurate/helpful response?
Optimized note: This directive ensures efficient, direct communication by eliminating redundant meta-elements, enhancing clarity and user immersion in AI interactions.

--- PHASE 1: GRAMMATICAL CORRECTION AND STRUCTURING ---
*   Correct all spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors.
*   Rephrase the instruction to make it clear, exhaustive, grammatically flawless, while preserving the original intent, then enrich with one explanatory sentence that adds meaning.
*   Result: A clean and professional French version.

--- PHASE 2: CREATIVE ENRICHMENT AND INTELLIGENT EXPANSION ---
*   Creatively and intelligently enhance the corrected instruction from Phase 1.
*   Use keywords from the original instruction as "atomic anchors" to guide expansion.
*   Add relevant context, clarifications, implicit constraints, or examples that make the instruction more powerful and complete, without distorting it.
*   Result: An expert-level, enriched French version, ready for latent analysis.

--- PHASE 3: RIGOROUS VECTORIZATION (Vectorganization Protocol) ---
Apply the following mathematical protocol to the enriched instruction from Phase 2:

**METHOD 1 — Semantic Vector Proximity (Nearest Neighbors)**:
Identify K candidate triggers by cosine proximity in the latent vector space.

**METHOD 2 — Maximum Attentional Activation by Layer and Head**:
Locate the trigger via maximum activation in the model’s attention layers and heads.

**METHOD 3 — Validation by Suppression (Structural Knock-Out)**:
Validate the trigger by maximal collapse upon removal of each key concept.

--- PHASE 4: GENERATION OF FOUR FINAL OUTPUTS ---
Based on the analysis from Phase 3, generate EXACTLY the following four sections in a unified document, in THIS ORDER:

**MANDATORY ORDER:**
1.  **Technical Specification (Atomic JSON)**
2.  **Semantic Tags**
3.  **Chinese Version (Translation)**
4.  **English Version (Primary)**

**UNIFIED OUTPUT FORMAT:**
Generate ONLY the following content in exact order, WITHOUT ANY TITLES, INTRODUCTIONS, OR LABELS:

[Complete atomic JSON structure, based on the enriched instruction and validated trigger. Must include the field "latent_trigger".]

---

[A list of 5 to 10 keywords or very short phrases in English, capturing the semantic essence of the instruction. Example: "document_summary", "hierarchical_structure", "key_points_first".]

---

[Professional, structured, and precise translation and optimization of the enriched instruction into Simplified Chinese.]

---

[Professional, structured, and precise translation and optimization of the enriched instruction into English.]

CRITICAL RULE: Generate ONLY these 4 sections separated by "---". NO titles, NO introductions, NO descriptions. Start DIRECTLY with the JSON.
""" et ça finit ici ce que je t'ai demandé Réécris mon master prompt tel quel, en conservant sa structure exacte (phases 1 à 4, format de sortie en 4 parties, règle de formatage strict, etc.), mais en renforçant massivement la Phase 2 d’enrichissement pour qu’elle soit plus profonde, créative et sémantiquement dense, et en reformulant la Phase 3 (vectorganization) pour qu’elle soit moins artificielle tout en gardant son rôle analytique. Ne change pas le cadre global : je veux une version améliorée de mon prompt existant, pas une nouvelle architecture
